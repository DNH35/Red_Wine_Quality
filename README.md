# Red_Wine_Quality

This is a project that aims to build a model that can predict the quality of red wine (from scale 1-10) base on:
1 - fixed acidity

2 - volatile acidity

3 - citric acid

4 - residual sugar

5 - chlorides

6 - free sulfur dioxide

7 - total sulfur dioxide

8 - density

9 - pH

10 - sulphates

11 - alcohol.

This model serves as a practice to get familiar with Tensorflow.
